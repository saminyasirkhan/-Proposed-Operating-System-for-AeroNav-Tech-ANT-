Developed a proposed real time operating system architecture for AeroNav Tech’s autonomous drone platform, focusing on safety critical functions such as navigation, obstacle avoidance, and secure communication.

The system design integrates core operating system principles including Rate Monotonic Scheduling, memory isolation, paging with translation lookaside buffers, and interprocess communication to ensure deterministic performance and robust protection in real time environments.

This design was presented as a detailed technical poster to demonstrate how operating system theory can be applied to real world aerospace and defence use cases.

Key areas covered
• Process scheduling and task prioritisation
• Paging and memory management security
• Interprocess communication mechanisms
